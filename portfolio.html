    <h2>Car parking application</h2>
    <p>This project was the last part of the DevOps Engineering program.
        The main concept was to create some sort of application that uses a database to store its data.
        I chose to create an application with a graphical user interface for a car parking monitor. The app is built with Python, Tkinter and CustomTkinter. For the database I chose to work with SQLite.
    Total amount of parking spaces for this specific parking lot is 50 spots where each registration number can't be duplicated for one single parking session. 
    The price is free of charge for the first 60 minutes, thereafter the price is set to 0.25 SEK/minute.
    The application has three main funtions: Start parking, See parked car status and Stop parking. 
    <em><br> The project is not complete.*</em>
    </p>

            <h3>Main menu</h3>
            <p>The main menu gives the client three options: Start parking, See Parked Car Status and Stop parking.
                Apart from the functions there's a price list displayed along with time, date and availabe parking spots.
            </p>

            <h3>Start Parking </h3>
            <p>After clicking on start parking on the main menu the client gets to the page demonstrated on the first picture below.
                Here the client gets asked to enter a registration number consisting of 6 characters.
                If the registration number is already entered in the database the client will get an error and will be asked to enter another number.
                If the number is formated correct and is unique, the parking session will be successfully started, shown on the second picture.</p>

            <img src="./images/app3.JPG" alt="">

            <h3>Parked car Status</h3>
            <p>This function displays a summary for each unique registration number.
                The summary includes Start date and time, Parking status, Total parking time and Current price.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/app5.JPG" alt="">

            <h3>Stop parking</h3>
            <p>The Stop parking function stops the parking timer for the entered registration number and gives a summary over the parking session, shown on the first picture.
                When the parking is stopped the client continues to a ''payment'' prompt, seen on the second picture. <br>
                <em>This function is not finished *</em>
