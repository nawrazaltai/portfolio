# My portfolio page

## Introduction
This porfolio is my first school project and is a part of the frontend-developer program. The main purpose with this assignment was to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript without using any libraries. The porfolio page is also made to express myself and showcase my work to eventuelly help me find an internship. This project is created by me, Nawras Altai. <br><br>Link to the page: https://nawrazaltai.github.io/portfolio/index.html
