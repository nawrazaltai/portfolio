                <h1>So, who am I?</h1>
                <p>My name is Nawras Altai and I'm a 28 year old frontend-developer student from Sweden. Apart from studying I'm currently working as a mentor
                    at an upper secondary school and I have been doing that the for the last 5 years. My main tasks are to design schedueles and create study plan for the students, make sure the students
                    complete their study plan and lead meetings with teachers and principals. The job itself is challenging and I enjoy the responsibilities that comes with it, however it's nothing I'm passionate about.
                    So I decided to change course to something I really like and is passionate about.
                    <br><br>
                    I started my journey studying DevOps in 2021, learning Python, Bash, monitoring and CI/CD was great but ending the semester with a frontend project made me realise
                    that I really prefer frontend work rather than backend. Making the change from DevOps to frontend developing was at the endy of the day an easy choice because since I was a kid I've always liked creating websites (at that time using online templates and knowing 0 about HTML and web development).
                    And that is how my journey as a frontend-developer started in the summer of '22 at Chas Academy in Stockholm. At the moment I'm learning
                    HTML, CSS and Javascript. What I really enjoy with developing websites and applications is designing and giving life to a project
                    through colors, animations and functionality. 
                    <br><br>
                    My short term goals for the nearest future are to get as good as possible with HTML, CSS and especially Javascript to then proceed with learning frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.
                    In 2023 the main focus will be to land an internship at company with the right environment for me to take my knowledge to the next level while showing my skills and abilities.
